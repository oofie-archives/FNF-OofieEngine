# Friday Night Funkin': Oofie Engine

Hello!

Welcome to the Oofie Engine repo.

In description, Oofie Engine is a forked version of the titular engine, Psych Engine. That aims to be an better version in my perspective. The main thing I'm trying to do is mainly make Psych optimized for low-end PCs. 
I hope to add more features soon while making this. 

As from the commits and engine itself, this engine is **HEAVILY** in developement.
